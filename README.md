<p style=”text-align: justify;”>This research proposes an innovative proposal combining the use of augmented reality and photogrammetry for modeling structures in digital format. It addresses two themes, the use of technologies for the restoration of heritage structures in the event of a fortuitous event and the use of a technological tool that allows the dissemination of the religious cultural heritage of the Cathedral of San Pedro in the city of Guayaquil, in Ecuador , to national and foreign tourists. The interest in knowing a little more about history, culture and art is encouraged when effective conservation strategies are involved and even more, incorporating the use of technology in smart devices. This allows quick, easy access and adequate viewing. The use of photogrammetry technique is adopted in several museums around the world and allows tourists to learn about a specific subject in an educational and interactive way. On the other hand, the augmented reality technique incorporates data in a virtual way (links on the web, audio, video, text or other multimedia) through some object markers, serving as a tool that encourages learning more about various topics, the one chosen in This work is the religious cultural heritage. The interface developed in Unity, and the use of the Vuforia development kit, through the mobile application “My Cathedral”, allows users to access the relevant historical information, visualizing the photogrammetric images in augmented reality, precisely on the most representative objects of the cathedral of San Pedro de Guayaquil.</p>
